# Bearing fault diagnosis based on Neural Network

A simple 5 layer fully connected Neural Network，used as an experimental project for learning softmax regression

The given data is the data of bearing in different fault states (normal, inner ring fault, outer ring fault, ball fault).

Be careful that the dataset is randomly generated and has no practical significance😁
